# Dotfiles

My collection of dotfiles managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). Feel free to take things you like at your own risk.

## Installation

Install chezmoi and my dotfiles with a single command
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply jacksongross
```

That's it! Everything should then be setup to be productive.
